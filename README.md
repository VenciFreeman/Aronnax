# Aronnax 

This repo is for SJTU [**Artificial Intelligence Integrated Circuit Design**]( https://www.idesign-ic.com/contest/contest.html ) Contest 2019. It's an on-campus competition which is similar to **Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge** ([LPIRC]( https://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/lpirc )).

Repo name *Aronnax* is a fictional character from *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers* by  *[Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne)*. Aronnax is a French marine biologist character, I hope this target recognition system is as fast and accurate as he is.

## Task

### Preliminary
+ Train object detection model.
+ Adopt some methods to optimize model, such as compression, pruning, etc.
+ Complete report and submit it before deadline

### Final
+ Implement neural network model using RTL or HLS (python)
+ Complete report and submit it before deadline
## Introduction

### Dataset
+ The contest focus on object detection for Four (4) different kind of objects, namely aeroplane, car, tv-monitor, and sofa.
+ These categories/classes are based on VOC dataset.
+ Note that all the files belongs to the same category/class.

### PYNQ-Z1
+ [Guide website](http://www.pynq.io/);

### Demo 
+ [More details](https://github.com/lgc2013/PYNQ-Classification);
+ Design based on this demo. Optimize this demo by own method or design it yourself.
